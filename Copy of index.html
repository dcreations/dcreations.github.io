<h2 style="color:red;"> WHY YOU SHOULD OWN A WEBSITE </h2>
<p> Every man has something uniquely deposited into him/her. This deposit could be in form of ideas, words, pictures, animations and so on. The beautiful thing is that these deposits are not just meant for the individual alone. As we might have heard; “there are people whose lives are connected to ours.” So that idea that you have might be the solution to someone else’s problem or challenge. 
That someone might not be close to your vicinity but you can still reach out to them. One way of doing this is by building a website: A website is online; it’s accessible 24/7 and can be accessed from anywhere around the globe. People could stumble on your site and the idea you take for granted could just be the saviour to their problems. So it’s a win-win for everyone. By this, you become a 
solution-provider, impacting people globally, touching lives, fulfilling your dreams and even expanding the coast of your vision.</p>

<p> What someone, a group, an organization, an industry or even a nation needs to breakthrough could be at your fingertips right now, help relate it to them by setting up a website.</p>

<p> <em>Don’t die with those ideas, spread it abroad. You can achieve this by building a website today!!</em></p>
 <strong> When you decide to build a website, do make an order... </strong> 

<h2 style="color:red;"> BENEFITS OF HAVING A WEBSITE </H2>

<h4 style="color:red;"> LOW-COST ADVERTISING </H4>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The Web has a far wider reach than any other
form of advertising. While it takes time to build up enough traffic to your website to
make a worthwhile impact on your company's marketing campaign, it costs next to nothing
to do so. Your website will be the center of your company's online presence; through it,
you advertise your business around the Web on social networking sites, forums and
through pay-per-click advertising programs.</P>

<H4 style="color:red;"> VISIBILITY </H4>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Increasing visibility is one major factor that
makes having a website important. Even if
people have heard about your company, they
may want to carry out research online first,
before leaving the house. Provide a map and
directions to your company's shops or offices
on your website so that visitors are less likely
to have trouble finding the place. </p>

<h4 style="color:red;"> ACCESSIBILITY </h4>
<p align="justify"> A website is online and accessible 24 hours a
day, every day of the year. Because of this,
your customers and potential customers can
visit your site for support or information
about new and upcoming products and
services whenever it is convenient for them.
Your website will act as an invaluable and
always-available resource for information
which would otherwise only be accessible
during your company's business hours.</p>
<H4 style="color:red;"> SALES </H4>
<P align="justify"> Your website can sell products at any time.
Potential customers are not restricted to
business hours. Instead, they can go online
and purchase products whenever they want. A
website with an online shop can provide a
dramatic boost in sales.</p>
<H4 style="color:red;"> TWO WORDS SAY EVERYTHING </H4>
<P align="justify"> A website is the most in-
depth information that you
can give the public , usually
in a word or two. By
promoting your website, on the front
door ( when you are closed ), on your
business cards, on the telephone to
someone looking for your location , in
your radio advertisements, on your
newspaper ad, everywhere - you can
essentially " tell " everything about your
operation with those simple words:
MyBusiness. com. So shouldn 't your web
site be an integral part of your total
marketing plan ?</p>
<H4 style="color:red;"> BUILD REPUTATION AND TRUST WITH POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS </H4>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Many of your potential
customers may not be
familiar with your company.
Web sites offer an ideal
forum to showcase your previous work
and accomplishments to potential
clients . A well designed website can help
convey a professional image of your
company and give you the chance to
make it clear to potential customers that
you offer exceptional products and
services . Customer testimonials ,
employee photographs, portfolio of past
work , etc . are excellent tools designed to
build trust and confidence with
customers.</P><br><br>
